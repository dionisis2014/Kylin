# Kylin
### An advanced mass-search tool

Kylin takes an unformatted input file and after applying (if specified) the necessary exclusions to those lines, opens the each one in a new browser tab.

**TODO:**
- Support for multiple browsers (only Firefox now)
- Batch search
- Correct conversions for all special characters (if specifically specified not to)
